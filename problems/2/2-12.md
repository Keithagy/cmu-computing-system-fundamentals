# Problem

Write C expressions, in terms of variable `x`, for the following values.
Your code should work for any word size `w >= 8`.
For reference, we show the result of evaluating the expressions for `x = 0x87654321`, with `w = 32`.
A. The least significant byte of x, with all other bits set to 0. ref: `[0x00000021]`

```c
y = x & 0xFF
```

B. All but the least significant byte of x complemented, with the least significant byte left unchanged. ref: `[0x789ABC21`

```c
y = (~x & (~0 << 8) | (x & 0xff))
```

```c
y = x ^ ~0xFF
```

C. The least significant byte set to all ones, and all other bytes of `x` left unchanged. ref: `[0x876543FF]`

```c
y = x | 0xFF
```
