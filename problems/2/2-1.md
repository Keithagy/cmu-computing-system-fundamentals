# Problem

Perform the following number conversions:

- 0x39A7F8 to binary
  - 00111001 10100111 11111000
- binary 1100100101111011 to hexadecimal
  - 0xC97B
- 0xD5E4C to binary
  - 11010101 11100100 01001100 (6 hex digits means 24 bits means 8 bytes. 2 hex digits give a byte.)
- binary 10 0110 1110 0111 1011 0101 to hexadecimal
  - Notice that here you actually don't have a blocks of 4.
  - If the total number of bits is not a multiple of 4, you should make the leftmost group be the one with fewer than 4 bits, effectively padding the number with leading zeros. Then you translate each group of bits into the corresponding hex digit.
  - 0x26E7B5
