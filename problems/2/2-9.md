# Problem

Computers generate color pictures on a video screen or liquid crystal display by mixing three different colors of light: red, green, and blue. Imagine a simple scheme, with three different lights, each of which can be turned on or off, projecting onto a glass screen.

We can then create eight different colors based on the absence (0) or presence (1) of light sources R, G, and B:

| R   | G   | B   | Color   |
| --- | --- | --- | ------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | Black   |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | Blue    |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | Green   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | Cyan    |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | Red     |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | Magenta |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | Yellow  |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | White   |

Each of these colors can be represented as a bit vector of length 3, and we can apply Boolean operations to them.

A. The complement of a color is formed by turning off the lights that are on and turning on the lights that are off. What would be the complement of each of the eight colors listed above?

- 111 White
- 110 Yellow
- 101 Magenta
- 100 Red
- 011 Cyan
- 010 Green
- 001 Blue
- 000 Black

B. Describe the effect of applying Boolean operations on the following colors:
Blue | Green = 011 Cyan
Yellow & Cyan = 010 Green
Red ^ Magenta = 001 Blue
